# Sokora Changelog

## 0.4.0 - Heijun - Work in progress

### Added

- Importing levelling data from MEE6, Tatsu, and Lurkr.
- (WIP) Level rewards.
- Upload one image to your news. (Cannot edit or remove images, nor add images from the edit modal.)
- Pinging users and roles, linking channels and adding custom timestamps to news. Discord doesn't allow this from the modal editor, so it uses a Dynamic Variables-ish syntax (Dynamic Mentions). See `/help variables` for info.
- Removing a user's messages when banning them. Use `/moderation ban user:@USER del:true` for this.
- Functional `/changelog` command (view all version logs directly from the bot).
- Settings changes logging.

### Changed

- Changed the formula to calculate levels and XP, it should now be better.
- Tweaked colors to ensure they're consistent across all embeds.

### Fixed

- Fixed `/moderation ban` not working on members not in the guild.
- Fixed some minor issues with timestamps.
- The "made with ❤️ by the Sokora team" footer in many embeds was supposed to randomize the emoji but it never did; fixed that too.
- `/moderation cases` now requires only the case ID or only the user ID to output a result.
- Reset button in `/settings` now appears when you change a text/integer setting.
- `/news`:
  - "News" are now "News posts".
  - Instead of "adding" news, you "post" news.
- Colors from the profile picture not working reliably (especially when the picture's dominant color is grayscale.)

### Changed

- User can't use any commands in DMs (thanks @userandaname)

### Fixed

- Top.gg reminders are fixed once more, now they should send **only** when you didn't vote
